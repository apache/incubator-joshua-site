title: Joshua 4.0 User Documentation
---

This page contains end-user oriented documentation for the 4.0 release of
[the Joshua decoder](http://joshua-decoder.org/).

## Quick start

If you just want to run the complete machine translation pipeline (beginning with data preparation,
through alignment, hierarchical model building, tuning, testing, and reporting), we recommend you
use our <a href="pipeline.html">pipeline script</a>.  You might also be interested in
[Chris' old walkthrough](http://cs.jhu.edu/~ccb/joshua/).

## More information

For more detail on the decoder itself, including its command-line options, see
[the Joshua decoder page](decoder.html).  You can also learn more about other steps of
[the Joshua MT pipeline](pipeline.html), including [grammar extraction](thrax.html) with Thrax and
Joshua's [efficient grammar representation](packing.html) (new with version 4.0).

If you have problems or issues, you might find some help [on our answers page](faq.html) or
[in the mailing list archives](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/joshua_support).
