title: Grammar extraction with Thrax
---

One day, this will hold Thrax documentation, including how to use Thrax, how to do grammar
filtering, and details on the configuration file options.  It will also include details about our
experience setting up and maintaining Hadoop cluster installations, knowledge wrought of hard-fought
sweat and tears.

In the meantime, please bother [Jonny Weese](http://cs.jhu.edu/~jonny/) if there is something you
need to do that you don't understand.  You might also be able to dig up some information [on the old
Thrax page](http://cs.jhu.edu/~jonny/thrax/).
